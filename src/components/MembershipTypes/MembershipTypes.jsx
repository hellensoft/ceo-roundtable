						Peer Group is a new and dynamic formula for the
						development of leaders from different business sectors.
						Peer Group consists of workshops focused on personal and
						professional development. Each group is based on the
						idea of sharing a strong common denominator, like
						similar needs, profiles, challenges, etc. (e.g.: CEO for
						CEE, CEO of Retail Companies, Women Leaders, etc). The
						main objectives of Peer Group are mutual inspiration,
						responding to individual needs of participants, and
						learning to tackle problems together.

						release pages in our website so that they can share
